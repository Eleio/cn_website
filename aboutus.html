        Welcome! We are a small sanctuary in the Canaan Valley that have been active since 2001, when the owner, Betty,
        started gathering stray rats in her shed. Her husband begged her to stop, but she wouldn't and here we are!

        Since then, Mary has built a support base of equally mad volunteers and 4 full time staff members. We appreciate
        all the support we get in the local community and are proud to be a MANSAFE non-profit organisation. Please
        browse our website if you are interested in adopting a furry friend, volunteering or donating. Thanks!
